HOW TO START THE APPLICATION
========================================

STEP 1: Install Dependencies (First Time Only)
------------------------------------------------
1. Double-click: install.bat
2. Wait 2-3 minutes - DO NOT cancel or close the window
3. You'll see many messages scrolling - this is normal!
4. Wait for "added XXX packages" message
5. When done, close the window

STEP 2: Start the Server
-------------------------
1. Double-click: start-dev.bat
2. Wait for: "Local: http://localhost:3000"
3. Open that URL in your browser

STEP 3: View Your Application
-------------------------------
- Home page: http://localhost:3000
- Upload a file to see the loading animation
- View results page with financial analysis

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- If port 3000 is busy, Next.js will use 3001 instead
- If you see "Next.js not found", run install.bat again
- Don't cancel npm install - it needs to complete!
